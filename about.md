I am a photographer and videographer travelling around LA. Shooting bands, models, and polititians.

I study at Pierce College, where I am the Associated Student Organization's (ASO) Publishing Commissioner. My job is to help the college's clubs popularize their events and make news easily accessable.

I ran an online video gaming community since I was 15, and ran events every week for two years straight. I averaged about fifty people gaming in each event. I organized it successfully because I did not base the community's membership based off rules, but instead by a belief system. Everyone who wanted to join took a pledge to "Honor, Respect, and Protect our Friends, Memebers, and Community." Each member held each other to the pledge and led to the creation of great events, lots of friends, and memories that will never be forgotten.
