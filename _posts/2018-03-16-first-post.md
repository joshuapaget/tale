Three weeks ago I picked up a camera and went down to Operation Gratitude. An oragnization where you can volunteer to help create care packages for the military and for the families of those in service. I went down, took my photos of their Assembly Day event, and sent them off to Operation Gratitude.

That's when I started getting LOTS of feedback on my photography. Encouraged to shoot more I started taking portraits of students and friends at Pierce College. I ended up making more friends, and the camera even helped make me more sociable. Now I'm doing photoshoots of models and polititians.

All without taking a single photography related class.

I have two sisters, one is a model and the other is a wedding photographer; and my Dad was one of Canada's top male model in his twenties. All of them have encouraged me to continue developing photography skills and I'm grateful to have such a supportive, loving family.

Photography is one-of-many skills I have, but it's the one that I'm known most for today.
